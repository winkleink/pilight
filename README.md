# pilight
Twitter Python change light
Inspired by Cheerlight an API to get a twitter feed that can then change the colour of an RGB LED.

Cheerlight is a single instance so all Cheerlight programs will change to the same colour. 

The goal for pilight is to have the ability to use multiple hash tags to permit the changing the colour of multiple items in a single project.
